# jasmin-desktop
Self Learning project.

This project is for windows and called personal assistant for your pc.

For this code I used **pyttsx3**--for selecting the voice, **datetime**--for wish function used to get "now"(time,date), **speech_recognition as sr**--for takecommand fn and used to convert user voice into strings, **wikipedia**--for wikipedia fn, **subprocess**--used to open files in windows, **vlc**--for play movies, **time**--for time delays, **os**--used to get access to pc windows, **random**--for generate random numbers, **smtplib**--for email fn and used to set server and port

It takes voice command from the user and give voice or visual output according to query. you can speak after display Listening....For example, if you say search wikipedia of amazon, then it will give wikipedia summary of amazon company and speak those lines. For example if you say open youtube, it will search path that contains youtube desktop application and open youtube for you. If you say send email, it will ask you what would you like to send and after you speak content of the mail it will ask name of the person whom you want to send mail and send it.If you speak feel then it will ask whom do you missing?, then you can speak person's name and it will find path of the picture of that person and show it, ETC.
